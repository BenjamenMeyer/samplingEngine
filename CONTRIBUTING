The public interface for this library is contained under "public".
All headers that will have a bound contract for integration into
other systems must be contained in this space. These headers must
be self contained and not reference any headers other than those
utilized by the C language and possibly the C++ language.

The internal interfaces for this library are contained under "include".
They may including references to the public interfaces and otherwise
have no restrictions.

Headers do not contain implementation - e.g. functions.
Helper functions (e.g simple C Macros or C++ inline functions) may
be contained here; but must be very limited in ability.
For example, the NORMALIZED_TO_SCALAR C Macro is a good function
to have here. Anything more complex should have its interface
defined in the headers, and an implementation defined under 'src'.

The source is included under 'src'. All implementation could must
go here.
