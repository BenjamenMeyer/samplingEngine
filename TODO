- Current geometryEngine implementation needs to be refactored as a Time Measurement Engine
- Measurement Engine should be setup to do: 
  - record consumption
  - pre-process filtering
  - calculation
  - post-process filtering
  - record generation
- A new user-defined record needs to be defined so users can delay random records, delays are based on the time index (time domain) or time index range (distance domain)
  - This is useful so users can inject data records relevant to their processing system, ex event records, that have no bearing on the data calculations but
    need to be preserved in the data stream accordingly.
- Write up the Engineering description in the ENGINEERING.RST file. This should capture:
  - overview
  - purpose
  - concept of operations
  - core requirements
  - architecture
  - functional requirements
  - example use cases
