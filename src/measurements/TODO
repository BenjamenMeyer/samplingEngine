Measurements To Implement:

- Diagnostic Wave
	* Configurable for Sine or Co-sine
- Tachometer
- Tachometer Delta
	* average over a sample window
- Tachometer Delta Change Rate
	* average over a sample window
	* rate of change -> speed
- Tachometer Delta Change Rate Change Rate
	* average over a sample window
	* rate of change of rate of change -> acceleration
- Forward/Reverse Detection
	* analyze Tachometer Delta to monitor direction
